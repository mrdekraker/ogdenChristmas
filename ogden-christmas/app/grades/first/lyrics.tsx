        Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul, <br/>
        With a corncob pipe and a button nose <br/>
        And two eyes made out of coal. <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say, <br/>
        He was made of snow but the children <br/>
        know how he came to life one day. <br/>
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        There must have been some magic in that <br/>
        Old silk hat they found. <br/>
        For when they placed it on his head <br/>
        He began to dance around. <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be, <br/>
        And the children say he could laugh <br/>
        and play just the same as you and me. <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Thumpetty thump thump, <br/>
        Thumpety thump thump, <br/>
        Look at Frosty go. <br/>
        Thumpetty thump thump, <br/>
        Thumpety thump thump, <br/>
        Over the hills of snow. <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Frosty the snowman<br/>
        knew the sun was hot that day, <br/>
        So he said, "Let's run and <br/>
        we'll have some fun now <br/>
        before I melt away." <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Down to the village, <br/>
        with a broomstick in his hand, <br/>
        Running here and there all <br/>
        around the square saying, <br/>
        "Catch me if you can." <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        He led them down the streets of town <br/>
        Right to the traffic cop. <br/>
        And he only paused a moment when <br/>
        He heard him holler "Stop!" <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Frosty the snowman <br />
        Had to hurry on his way, <br />
        But he waved goodbye saying, <br />
        "Don't you cry, <br />
        I'll be back again some day." <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Thumpetty thump thump, <br />
        Thumpety thump thump, <br />
        Look at Frosty go. <br />
        Thumpetty thump thump, <br />
        Thumpety thump thump, <br />
        Over the hills of snow. <br />
      </p>
    </div>
