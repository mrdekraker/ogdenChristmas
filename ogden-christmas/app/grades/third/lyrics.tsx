        Have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        It's the best time of the year <br />
        I don't know if there'll be snow <br />
        But have a cup of cheer <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        And when you walk down the street <br />
        Say hello to friends you know <br />
        And everyone you meet <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Oh, ho, the mistletoe <br />
        Hung where you can see <br />
        Somebody waits for you <br />
        Kiss her once for me <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        And in case you didn't hear <br />
        Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        This year <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Oh, ho, the mistletoe <br />
        Hung where you can see <br />
        Somebody waits for you <br />
        Kiss her once for me <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        In case you didn't hear <br />
        Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas <br />
        This year <br />
      </p>
