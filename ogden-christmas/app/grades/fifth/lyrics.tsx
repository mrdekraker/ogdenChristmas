        I don't want a lot for Christmas <br />
        There is just one thing I need <br />
        I don't care about the presents <br />
        Underneath the Christmas tree <br />
        I just want you for my own <br />
        More than you could ever know <br />
        Make my wish come true <br />
        All I want for Christmas <br />
        Is you <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        I don't want a lot for Christmas <br />
        There is just one thing I need (And I)<br />
        I don't care about the presents <br />
        Underneath the Christmas tree <br />
        I don't need to hang my stocking <br />
        There upon the fireplace (Ahhh) <br />
        Santa Claus won't make me happy <br />
        With a toy on Christmas day <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        I just want you for my own <br />
        More than you could ever know <br />
        Make my wish come true <br />
        All I want for Christmas is you <br />
        You baby <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        I won't ask for much this Christmas <br />
        I won't even wish for snow <br />
        I'm just gonna keep on waiting <br />
        Underneath the mistletoe <br />
        I won't make a list and send it <br />
        To the North Pole for Saint Nick <br />
        I won't even stay awake to <br />
        Hear those magic reindeer click <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        'Cause I just want you here tonight <br />
        Holding on to me so tight <br />
        What more can I do <br />
        Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you <br />
        You, baby <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        Oh, all the lights are shining <br />
        So brightly everywhere <br />
        And the sound of children's <br />
        Laughter fills the air <br />
        And everyone is singing <br />
        I hear those sleigh bells ringing <br />
        Santa won't you bring me <br />
        The one I really need <br />
        Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly <br />
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg m-1">
        I don't want a lot for Christmas <br />
        This is all I'm asking for <br />
        I just wanna see my baby <br />
        Standing right outside my door <br />
        I just want you for my own <br />
        More than you could ever know <br />
        Make my wish come true <br />
        Baby all I want for Christmas is <br />
        You <br />
      </p>
    </div>
